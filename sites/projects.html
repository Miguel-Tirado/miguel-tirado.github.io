                         the collisions of low-speed personal vehicles. The devices use a collision

                         to collision from one device to the other. The devices communicate with each 
                         other by sending and receiving their location and velocity wirelessly through

                        operating system by using a special development operating environment called SPEDE. The 
                        operating system ran on Intel’s x86 CPU architecture where a MS DOS based environment was used 
                        for testing and Ubuntu Linux was used for development. These environments were run on a virtual 
                        machine due to the global pandemic. Topics covered and implemented in our operating system are 
                        the Kernel, Processes, and Interprocess Communication. The operating system used its own api 
                        and was programmed in C and inline assembly.

                        Developed a solar tracker for a class final project with a team of 3. The final 
                        project was planned to take 5 weeks, but the CA fires disrupted the time set. 
                        The team finished in a record 3 weeks, meeting a tight schedule by ramping up 
                        meetings and delivery of code. Personally, built the foundation for the solar 
                        tracker and wrote a 40-line C script on a parallax board that was designed to 
                        detect light and rotate the servos from east to west depending on the sun light 
                        level. Convinced the team that we could streamline the development by using 
                        Bitbucket to manage our code and Slack to collaborate and communicate changes 
                        and updates with team members working remotely.

                         display property. Flexbox grid is also very similar to bootstrap since it uses the conventions for
